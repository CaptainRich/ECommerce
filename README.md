## Project Objective
AS A manager at an Internet Retail company, I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API,

1) When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

2) When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

3) When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

4) When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

5) When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
